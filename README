Gruta is a blogging tool with support for ActivityPub, Webmention, Tweeter, static
generation and more.

This package is called pygruta and is a Python port/rework/reboot of the original
Perl version.

Things that work by now:

 * Almost complete support for Gruta database maintenance in FS format
   for topics, stories, users, followers and indexes.
 * Snapshotting to a static site.
 * ActivityPub support: reception of messages, direct messages,
   likes and boosts (from the server) and feed sending to followers
   (from the command-line tool).
 * Webmention support: reception of mentions (from the server) and
   propagation of mentions in Gruta stories (from the command-line tool).
 * Twitter feed-posting and searches (from the command-line tool).
 * Notifications via Telegram.
 * Online maintenance works for stories and topics.

Things that do not work:

 * The SQL storage of the Gruta database (it won't probably be ported).
 * Comments to stories (probably will never be ported).

This software is released into the public domain.

Requirements outside Python standard library:

 * lxml
 * urllib3
 * OpenSSL (for ActivityPub)
 * twython (for Twitter)
